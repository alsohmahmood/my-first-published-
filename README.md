My first project to learn and share -Python-Keylogger
This is my first project. I designed it to test the Keylogger program and also to test file sharing on the website. This program reads keyboard keys and can take a screenshot every ten seconds. When you press the Escape button, it closes. 
This program is designed for educational purposes only.
